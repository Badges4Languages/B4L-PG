This plugin is a complement to the Open Badges Framework plugin. It allows users to request certified badges by providing proofs of their level.

== Description ==

For students, this plugin allows them to choose a language and the level they have in this language (A1, A2, ...) and request the certified badge related to this language and level. In order for the administrator to certify this level, the student need to provide a proof of what he's requesting (as a PDF or picture).

For teachers, this plugin allows too to request a certified badge in the same way than students. But they also have to fill a form with different sections :

* Language
* Qualification
* Core Competencies
* Complementary Skills

For each of these sections, the teacher can check his competencies. Depends on what the teacher checked, the plugin will retrieve a level (A1, A2, ...) for each sections. In the same way than students, the teacher has to provide a proof for each section to certify his competencies.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire b4l-profiling-grid-for-teachers folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
